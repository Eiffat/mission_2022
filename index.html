            <p>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, often shortened to Hogwarts, is the British wizarding
                school, located in the Scottish Highlands.It accepts magical students from Great Britain and
                Ireland for enrollment.It is a state-owned school, funded by the Ministry of Magic.

                The precise location of the school could never be uncovered because it should be rendered Unplottable.
                To
                Muggles, the school appears to be an old, abandoned castle. Similarly, most wizarding schools'
                locations are protected in order to prevent their ways of teaching being revealed, as well as protect
                the students and schools themselves from any harm.</p>
